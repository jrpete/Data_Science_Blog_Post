# README

## Motivation
The Jupyter Notebook associated with this README uses Approved and Rejected loan data obtained from [Lending Tree](https://www.lendingtree.com/) to sanitize, model, 
and analyze a subset of factors related to a loan applicant that might lead them to be approved or denied.  


## Libraries
This project was completed using the following dependencies:

	- Jupyter Notebook v6.0.1
	- Python v3.7.4
	- Pandas v0.25.1
	- Numpy v1.16.5
	- Sklearn v0.22.1
	- Matplotlib v3.1.1

## Files
The data associated with this project was obtained from Lending Club 2018 Q4 Historical Loan Issuance Data, which can be accessed 
at the following link after creating a profile on their website. 

https://www.lendingclub.com/statistics/additional-statistics?

The accepted and rejected loan files obtained from this link should match the file descriptions below: 
	
	1. accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv
		- a list of loan applications from 2007 - 2018Q4 that were accepted by the lending institution
	2. rejected_2007_to_2018Q4.csv
		- a list of loan applications from 2007 - 2018Q4 that were rejected by the lending institution
